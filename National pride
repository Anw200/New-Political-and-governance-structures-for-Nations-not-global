Statement on Nations, Cultures, and Global Diversity
The world is made up of many nations, cultures, histories, and philosophies. No person, group, or nation can claim to know with certainty who is right or wrong, and no one has the authority to judge the existence or identity of another. What must remain absolute is the right of every people to preserve their own culture, traditions, and way of life.
A one‑world government can never be acceptable, because humanity does not know which culture, philosophy, or system carries the seeds of the future. Nations rise and fall, ideas evolve, and diversity is the foundation of resilience. Just as we cannot predict which genetic traits will allow humanity to thrive over the next thousand years, we cannot predict which cultural or national paths will prove essential for our survival or flourishing.
Therefore, we must assume that the nations and cultures that exist today are the building blocks we have to work with. Disagreements and debates within nations are local matters, to be resolved by the people who live within those communities. Nations must respect one another in the same way individuals respect others in the same room: with dignity, boundaries, and mutual recognition.
Preservation of nations and cultures is essential. The future of humanity depends on diversity, not uniformity, and no global system should override the right of any people to remain themselves.
